# Details instructions

"Details (x)" folders are untouched OOTB content libraries used by some of the Tway Tool Catalogs. They are only added to this repository to ensure that the required librairies are available.

All adjusted and new contents are stored in the "Tway (x)" folders as **ADDITIONNAL** librairies.
