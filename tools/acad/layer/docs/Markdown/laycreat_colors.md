# Color Mapping Guide

Here is a description of all the standard color attributions used by the **LAYCREAT** project, all new data added by contributors should match the present guide.

## CTB index

All colors are preset to work with the Aec Ctb's included with the "acad-support" repository (coming soon). The Ctb's are based on revised version of the "tri-service color mapping" and uses all the index colors from 1 to 255 as describe below:

### All color plot black

```standard
- xx0 = 0.13mm
- xx1 = 0.18mm
- xx2 = 0.25mm
- xx3 = 0.35mm
- xx4 = 0.50mm
- xx5 = 0.70mm
- xx6 = 1.00mm
- xx7 = 1.40mm
- xx8 = 2.00mm
```

### Exceptions

```exception
Always grey :

- 008 = 0.13mm dark grey (rgb 128)
- 009 = 0.13mm light grey (rgb 192)

Variable based on selected CTB (dark grey or black):

- xx9 = 0.13mm (mostly for patterns)
- 200 = 0.13mm (for most screening scenarios)
- 201 = 0.18mm ""
- 202 = 0.25mm ""
- 203 = 0.35mm ""
- 204 = 0.50mm ""
- 205 = 0.70mm ""
- 206 = 1.00mm ""
- 207 = 1.40mm ""
- 208 = 2.00mm ""

True color shade of grey :

- 250 = 0.13mm grey (rgb 84)
- 251 = 0.13mm grey (rgb 118)
- 252 = 0.13mm grey (rgb 152)
- 253 = 0.13mm grey (rgb 186)
- 254 = 0.13mm grey (rgb 219)
