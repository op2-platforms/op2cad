# op2cad | platform
Fast open source development platform for computer assisted drawings in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction industries.

> Be aware! This platform is under heavy development and lightly experimented with yet (Q3 2022). You may use and experiment with it at your own risk. Any contribution, shared content or knowledge are always welcome and appreciated.

## Story

On first abord, CAD softwares tends to feel pretty straightforward and quite limitless; which is to be liked to anyone started of in a BIM application like Revit for exemple. However, when setting thing up for yourself or your company, things can get much trickier and the boundary start to show up little by little as you are moving forward.

More complicated things are becoming and more important it will be to have a proper way of developing, deploying and maintaining your quality CAD contents.

This platform is my thought process outcome about how to manage content using Git powerful features.

It was designed to be the foundation of any personnal or office standard in order to quickly and easily jump-in to the CAD world with premium base contents complementing the software original contents.
