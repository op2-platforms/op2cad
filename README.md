# op2cad | platform
Fast open source development and content management platform for Computer Assisted Drawings (CAD) in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction industries.

> Be aware! This platform is under heavy development and lightly experimented with yet (Q3 2022). You may use and experiment with it at your own risk. Any contribution, shared content or knowledge are always welcome and appreciated.

## Story

On first abord, CAD softwares tends to feel pretty straightforward and quite limitless; which is to be liked to anyone starting of, for exemple, in a BIM application like Revit. However, when setting thing up for yourself or your company, things can get much trickier as the boundary start to show up little by little.

More complicated things are and more important it become to have a proper way of developing, deploying and maintaining your CAD contents.

This platform is my thought process outcome about how to manage contents using Git powerful features and a way to angage with the community to use each other strengh and resources to create even more quality contents for everyone.

## The Design

**op2cad** was thought to be the foundation for any of your personnal or office standard in order to quickly and easily jump-in to CAD with premium collaborative contents complementing the software original contents.

Using Git features, all the CAD contents can be stored directly on the C drive instead of a shared cloud or local server, allowing everyone to experiment on there own machine without fear to disturbed other people work and synchronized back only the finished quality contents. 

The current prefered way to work is to "Fork" the [main repository](https://github.com/op2-platforms/op2cad/edit/main) to your own or company GitHub account and clone this newly made repository to your C drive in a GitHub folder: [C:\GitHub\op2cad]. This way you can use all the preset projet and application paths and get going right away.
