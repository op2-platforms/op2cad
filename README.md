The **"Open Source CAD Softwares Optimization Platform"** is a fast development and content management collaborative platform for the AEC industries.

It is mainly focused around Autodesk product line-up, but may be further expended to other softwares.

It is meant to be the foundation for any office standard on which you can continously build on for further improvement utilising the Git platform for synchronise your content locally and experiment away from your office centralized database. You can then decide to manage a centralize copy as well but I highly encourage using the Git platform for revision control.

## Getting Started

1. Before you start anything; make sure you have [Git latest version](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine.
2. Make a Clone on your local machine using the Git GUI or any of your [prefered GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
  for GUI recommandations and cloning location, see *cloning instruction coming soon*
3. Go to your desired application folder and follow the [App Setup Guide]
