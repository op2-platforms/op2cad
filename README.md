# op2cad | platform
Fast open source development and content management platform for Computer Assisted Drawings (CAD) in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction industries.

> Be aware! This platform is under heavy development and lightly experimented with yet (Q3 2022). You may use and experiment with it at your own risk. Any contribution, shared content or knowledge are always welcome and appreciated.

## Story

On first abord, CAD softwares tends to feel pretty straightforward and quite limitless; which is to be liked to anyone starting of, for exemple, in a BIM application like Revit. However, when setting thing up for yourself or your company, things can get much trickier as the boundary start to show up little by little.

More complicated things are and more important it become to have a proper way of developing, deploying and maintaining your CAD contents.

This platform is my thought process outcome about how to manage contents using Git powerful features and a way to angage with the community to use each other strengh and resources to create even more quality contents for everyone.

## The Design

**op2cad** was thought to be the foundation for any of your personnal or office standard in order to quickly and easily jump-in to the CAD world with premium collaborative base contents complementing the software original contents while still having the ability to implement customized personnal or office contents.

Using Git, you can stored the contents on your local machine, on an external hard drive, local server, personnal cloud or pretty much anywhere you want. The current prefered way is to Fork the main repository, and clone this newly made repository to your default GitHub folder: [C:\Users\UserName\Documents\GitHub]. This way, if you have access to a OneDrive account; your personnal repository should be sync on all your machines. If you are not using OneDrive service but have access to an other cloud service; simply clone the repository in a cloud synchronised folder and it should work just as well.
